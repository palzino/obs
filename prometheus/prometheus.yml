# Alloy handles all scraping and sends metrics here via remote_write API
# The --web.enable-lifecycle flag in docker-compose.yml enables the remote write receiver

# No scrape_configs needed - Alloy does all the scraping
# This prevents duplicate metrics and makes Alloy the central collection point
